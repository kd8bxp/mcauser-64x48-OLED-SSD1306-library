Jan 2018 - updated modification by mcauser by renaming library, this way I could have both this library and the Original Adafruit Library.
Use this with the D1 Mini Mini OLED (64x48) 
The library works the same, only it's
Adafruit_D1_SSD1306.h otherwise should be the same.
Please see original project, https://github.com/mcauser/Adafruit_SSD1306/tree/esp8266-64x48
I've made no changes other than for naming reasons.
